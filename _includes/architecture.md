Our Drupal architecture is designed to provide a resilient platform to host your content in a Private Cloud. We have optimized every component of the stack for Cloud Infrastructure. With a deployment driven by OpenStack Orchestration (heat) and Salt configuration management, we are able to deliver Drupal as a repeatable, scalable, production-ready deployment.
