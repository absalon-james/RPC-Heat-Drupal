- Out of the box performance enhancements made to Drupal, Apache, PHP, and Galera. This includes PHP object caching, Memcached integration, Apache and performance configuration settings, and more.
- Network isolation and security group isolation at various levels within the stack provide enhanced Cloud security. The database servers are isolated from the web tier DMZ, and only available through a bastion gateway load balancer to furher protect data.

- We utilize Galera clustering and MariaDB to provide true a multi-master MySQL backend for Drupal. This allows the application to better withstand the higher failure rates of commodity/older infrastructure found in Cloud environments.

- We have found that centralized network file servers have higher failure rates in cloud environments, are more difficult to ensure data integrity, and almost always suffer performance loss. Our architecture utilizes csync2 and lsyncd to push data to other servers on creation events. This minimizes data traffic and allows for substantially more application servers to participate in the cluster. We also utilize sticky sessions on the front end load balancer to maintain user experience while the sync events are taking place.

- SSL termination at the load balancer allows for secure customer transactions while not having the added CPU overhead of computing SSL on application instances. Network isolation and firewalling keeps non-ssl traffic isolated from outside networks.
